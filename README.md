# 🏥 Breast Cancer Classification - Data Science Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **breast cancer data** to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that aid in understanding the disease and supporting healthcare decisions. Using **machine learning models**, we classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** to assist in early detection and prevention.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
### 🔍 **Data Exploration**
- Understanding feature distribution.
- Identifying correlations between attributes.
- Visualizing patterns in the dataset.

### 🔧 **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values.
- Normalizing/Scaling features for uniformity.
- Performing feature selection & engineering.

### 🤖 **Model Development**
- Building **classification models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Evaluating model performance using:
  - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**

### 📊 **Insights & Recommendations**
- Extracting **actionable insights** from the analysis.
- Suggesting approaches for **early detection & prevention**.
